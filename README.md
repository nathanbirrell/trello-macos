Use Trello as a native macOS application (unofficial).

## Why?

* Trello does not currently have a native/webview app
* It is nice to alt-tab your way to Trello
* Remembers your state, so you can pick up where you left off (on any particular board/card)
* Includes expected keyboard shortcuts

## Disclaimer

This app is in no way endorsed by Trello, I am simply a big Trello user and like to have it in my macOS Dock.
