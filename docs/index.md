![Screenshot of Trello for Mac in action]({{site.url}}/screenshot.png)

## Why?

* Trello does not currently have a native/webview app
* It is nice to alt-tab your way to Trello
* Remembers your state, so you can pick up where you left off (on any particular board/card)
* Includes expected keyboard shortcuts

## Ideas?

[Create an issue](https://github.com/nathanbirrell/trello-macos/issues)

*Please note: as this is a free application, I have not paid for the $150 Apple Developer Program to sign it. This means you will get an "Unidentified Developer" warning from macOS's Gatekeeper. [Go here to open the app regardless](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25088?locale=en_US)*

## Disclaimer

This app is in no way endorsed by Trello, I am simply a big Trello user and like to have it in my macOS Dock.
